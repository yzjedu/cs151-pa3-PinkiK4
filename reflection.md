I was supposed to learn how to use user inputs and string manipulation prompts to manipulate strings to design and 
output various types ASCII art.

I began by identifying the problem I needed to solve. After, I began breaking down the problems in the code into functions.
After, I began solving the problem within the function. Lastly, I did various tests on the code to ensure it held.
The key concepts that I explored were string modifications, error-checking, and looping.

My results took time and various tests, but eventually it matched what I expected to get. I tried various test cases on 
both sides of the extreme.

I encountered challenges with the line function since I wasn't familiar with how to achieve all the tasks the function required.
I went back to the ZYbooks and concepts we reviewed in the notes to figure out how to achieve the results. I definitely learned
what I required for this project, and I enjoyed working with myself.
